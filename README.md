# tridim-cognition-ui

An immersive, canvas-based rendering engine for layered cognition boards — built with React and designed for tridimensional chess simulations.

## 🚀 Features

- Canvas-based board rendering with animation support
- Modular component structure (`BoardRenderer.js`)
- Ready for cognition trail overlays and hover/click interactivity
- GitHub-ready for collaboration and onboarding

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Benjamin-svg166/tridim-cognition-ui.git
   cd tridim-cognition-ui

## 🧠 Cognition Trail Roadmap

This project is evolving toward a fully interactive cognition simulation platform. The cognition trail system will visualize layered thought processes, strategic depth, and decision pathways in tridimensional chess. Here's the roadmap:

### 🔹 Phase 1: Trail Infrastructure
- [x] Canvas-based board rendering
- [ ] Define trail data structure (nodes, pulses, timestamps)
- [ ] Implement hover/click triggers for cognition nodes
- [ ] Animate cognition pulses across layers

### 🔹 Phase 2: Simulation Logic
- [ ] Encode decision trees and strategic branches
- [ ] Render trail overlays based on move history
- [ ] Integrate cognition trail playback (step-through mode)

### 🔹 Phase 3: Collaboration & Expansion
- [ ] Document trail API for external modules
- [ ] Enable real-time cognition sharing (WebSocket or peer sync)
- [ ] Add contributor guidelines for trail extensions

Want to contribute to the cognition trail system? Start by exploring `BoardRenderer.js` and proposing a trail schema in `src/trails/`. All ideas welcome.
